Thank you for meeting with me this afternoon to discuss the Quality Analyst (QAII) position. I enjoyed our conversation, and I am very excited about the possibility of joining your team.
I don’t see the quality analyst role as a punch-the-clock, 8-to-5 job; I will be your “right hand: -- helping you manage the day-to-day operations, monitor and analyze the stability study, volunteering for special projects, and ensuring the company is positioned for growth and increased profitability.
The interview convinced me of how compatible my background, interests, and skills are with the goals of this position. My attention-to detail, ability to focus on projects, dedication, continuously improve, strong technical background and good communication skills are the great strengths. I wish to join a competent team wherein I can add value to projects and in turn, take home learning as well. What is more, this position also offers me a chance to advancement. I feel I could learn a great deal from you and would certainly enjoy working with you. 

Please feel free to contact me if you need additional information, have any questions or would like to offer me the job! Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
